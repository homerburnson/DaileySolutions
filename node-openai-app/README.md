# Node OpenAI App

This is a full-stack Node.js application that integrates with OpenAI's API to generate dynamic responses based on user input. The project includes a backend powered by Express.js and a frontend built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML.

---

## Overview

- **Backend**: Manages API requests, file uploads, and communication with OpenAI.
- **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for querying the AI, uploading files, and interacting with the app.
- **Use Case**: Designed to showcase CVs, cover letters, and job application materials, with the ability to query OpenAI and manage content.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd node-openai-app
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the App

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open the frontend:
   - Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
   - Serve the `public` folder using a local server (e.g., `http-server`).

---

## Features

- **Query OpenAI**: Enter a prompt and receive a response generated by the OpenAI model.
- **Dynamic Context**: The app dynamically includes CV, cover letter, and job description text files in the OpenAI context window based on a keyword.
- **Download CV**: A button allows users to download Luke's CV from the `cv_public` folder.
- **File Upload**: Upload `.txt` files to specific folders (`covers`, `cv`, `jobs`) via the `/uploaddocs` page.
- **File Management**: View, edit, and delete uploaded files directly from the `/uploaddocs` page.

---

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the main interface.
- Use the `/uploaddocs` route to upload and manage `.txt` files.
- Pass a `keyword` in the query to dynamically load specific CV, cover letter, and job description files into the OpenAI context.

## Future Potential

This application was built with flexibility in mind. While it currently showcases one individual’s professional profile, it is fully compatible with other CVs, cover letters, and job materials. This means other users can upload their own documents and leverage the app as a personal assistant for job seeking and professional interactions.

In the future, the app could:

- Serve as a dynamic, AI-powered portfolio or digital résumé for multiple users.
- Act as a personalized chatbot that role-plays as a job applicant, answering recruiter questions.
- Generate tailored application materials (e.g., cover letters) from uploaded job descriptions.
- Enable secure, shareable links for prospective employers to interact with a candidate’s chatbot persona.

The modular design supports these enhancements with minimal changes, encouraging experimentation with AI-driven representations of professional identity.
