# Node OpenAI App

This is a full-stack Node.js application that integrates with OpenAI's API to generate dynamic responses based on user input. The project includes a backend powered by Express.js and a frontend built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML. It incorporates a Qdrant database (best in benchmarking tests and more scalable than Chroma).

---

## Overview

- **Backend**: Manages API requests, file uploads, and communication with OpenAI.
- **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for querying the AI, uploading files, and interacting with the app.
- **Use Case**: Designed to showcase CVs, cover letters, and job application materials, with the ability to query OpenAI and manage content.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd node-openai-app
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the App

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open the frontend:
   - Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
   - Serve the `public` folder using a local server (e.g., `http-server`).

---

## Features

- **Query OpenAI**: Enter a prompt and receive a response generated by the OpenAI model.
- **Dynamic Context**: The app dynamically includes CV, cover letter, and job description text files in the OpenAI context window based on a keyword.
- **Download CV**: A button allows users to download the CV from the `cv_public` folder.
- **File Upload**: Upload `.txt` files to specific folders (`bio`, `covers`, `cv`, `jobs`, `company`, `user`) via the `/uploaddocs` page.
- **File Management**: View, edit, and delete uploaded files directly from the `/uploaddocs` page.

---

## Implementation

To implement this app for another user, follow these steps:

### Technical Implementation

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with the user's details:
     - `NAME`: The user's name.
     - `TITLE`: The user's title or role.
     - `BRAND`: The user's expertise or brand.
     - `LOCATION`: The user's location.

### Funtional Implementation

The following steps can be completed through the user interface by going to
```
   <url>/uploaddocs
```
for example, if this is running locally on your laptopm, go to:

```
     http://localhost:3000/uploaddocs
```

2. **Prepare Required Files**:
   - At a minimum, the following files should be created and uploaded to the relevant folders in `backend/texts`:
     - `bio.txt` in the `bio` folder: A brief biography of the user.
     - A standard cover letter in the `covers` folder.
     - A standard CV in the `cv` folder.

3. **Optional Files**:
   - Additional files can be uploaded to the `company`, `jobs`, and `user` folders. These files can be tied together using a unique keyword.

4. **Bundle Documents with Keywords**:
   - To group documents for a specific context, insert the same unique keyword into the filenames or content of the files.
   - For example, if targeting a company named "TechCorp," use the keyword `TechCorp` in the filenames or content of the files in the `company`, `jobs`, and `user` folders.

5. **Use Base64 Encoding for Keywords**:
   - Encode the keyword in Base64 and pass it as a query parameter in the URL:
     ```
     <url>?state=<base64encodedstring>
     ```
   - For example, to target "TechCorp," encode the keyword in a terminal like so:
     ```bash
     echo -n "TechCorp" | base64
     ```
     This will produce `VGVjaENvcnA=`.
   - Use the URL:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000/?state=VGVjaENvcnA=
     ```
     Or go to a website such as https://www.base64encode.org/ and follow ths instructions to encode your string online.

6. **Dynamic Context Loading**:
   - When the app detects the `state` query parameter, it decodes the Base64 string and uses the keyword to load the relevant files into the OpenAI context window for that session i.e. it will answer questions using the files you uploaded which cotnain that keyword, for context.

---

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the main interface.
- Use the `/uploaddocs` route to upload and manage `.txt` files.
- Pass a `state` query parameter in the URL to dynamically load specific bundles of documents into the OpenAI context.

## Future Potential

This application was built with flexibility in mind. While it currently showcases one individual’s professional profile, it is fully compatible with other CVs, cover letters, and job materials. This means other users can upload their own documents and leverage the app as a personal assistant for job seeking and professional interactions.

In the future, the app could:

- Serve as a dynamic, AI-powered portfolio or digital résumé for multiple users.
- Act as a personalized chatbot that role-plays as a job applicant, answering recruiter questions.
- Generate tailored application materials (e.g., cover letters) from uploaded job descriptions.
- Enable secure, shareable links for prospective employers to interact with a candidate’s chatbot persona.

The modular design supports these enhancements with minimal changes, encouraging experimentation with AI-driven representations of professional identity.

## Feature Backlog

The following features are planned for future development but are currently on hold due to time and cost constraints:

1. **Voice Functionality**:
   - Add the ability for the app to interact with users via voice input and output.
   - Use third-party or open-source software to process voice commands and generate spoken responses.

2. **Voice Mimicry**:
   - Implement functionality to mimic a specific voice for the assistant, making interactions more personalized.
   - Use advanced voice synthesis tools to replicate tone, pitch, and style.

3. **Tone Mimicry in Writing**:
   - Enhance the assistant's ability to mimic specific tones or writing styles based on user preferences or context.
   - Allow users to specify a tone (e.g., formal, casual, persuasive) for responses.

4. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Refine prompts sent to the OpenAI API to ensure they are optimized for the app's use case.
   - Introduce **suggested prompts** in the user interface to guide users in interacting with the app effectively.
   - Upgrade **conversation history** to store conversations in a database.
   - 
   - easy UI - generate a URL to access when tying docs together with a base64 parameter.

These features would significantly enhance the app's interactivity and personalization. However, they require additional resources and development time, making them part of a longer-term roadmap.
